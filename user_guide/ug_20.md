# Pattern matching

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_19.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_20.1.md)

ScriptBasic provides a simple, yet powerful pattern matching mechanism
that eases string handling. ScriptBasic pattern matching is based on
wild card patterns and not regular expressions. There is an external
module called `RE` that implements regular expression based pattern
matching.

The pattern matching that ScriptBasic provides is simpler and therefore
easier to learn and use. Most programs do not need the power of regular
expression match.
