# RIGHT Details

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.171.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.172.md)

`RIGHT(x,y)` cuts out a substring of `y` characters from the right of
the string `x`. If the first argument is not defined the result is also
`undef`. Otherwise the first argument is converted to string and the
second argument is converted to integer value.

If the second argument is not defined or has negative value it is
treated as numeric zero and as such the result string will be empty
string.

For compatibility reasons you can append a dollar (`$`) sign to the end
of the function identifier.
