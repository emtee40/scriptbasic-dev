@cinde binary mode files

Whenever you have opened a file in a mode you may want to switch the
mode. You can not switch between reading and writing mode, but you can
switch between binary and textual mode. To do this there are two
commands:

    binmode [#] fn

and

    textmode [#] fn

The sign `#` is optional. The argument `fn` should be the file number of
an opened file. These commands are implemented on the Windows operating
system, but can also be used under UNIX with no effect. The use of these
commands under UNIX results more portable code.

There are two files automatically opened in almost any environment.
These are the standard input and the standard output. You can switch the
mode how the program handles these files using these commands. You can
say

    Binmode input
    Binmode output

to switch the standard input and output to binary mode and also

    Textmode input
    Textmode output

to switch the standard input and output to text mode. Use of these
commands is extremely useful writing Windows NT cgi programs that output
binary data, for example a png file.
