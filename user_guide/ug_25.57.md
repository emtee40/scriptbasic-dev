# EXIT SUB

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.56.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.58.md)

This function stops the execution of a subroutine and the execution gets
back to the point from where the subroutine was called. Executing this
command has the same effect as if the execution has reached the end of a
subroutine.

Same as [EXITFUNC](ug.md)
