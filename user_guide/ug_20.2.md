# The function JOKER

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_20.1.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_20.3.md)

We can match a string to a pattern, but that is little use, unless we
can tell what sub-string the joker or wildcard characters matched. For
the purpose the function @cide{JOKER} is available. The argument of this
function is an integer number, n starting from 1 and the result is the
sub-string that the last pattern matching operator found to match the
n-th joker or wild card character. For example

    Const nl="\n"
    if "file.txt" like "*.*" then
      print "File=",joker(1)," extension=",joker(2),nl
    
    else
    
      print "did not match"
    endif 

will print

    File=file extension=txt

If the pattern did not match the string or the argument of the function
`JOKER` is zero or negative, or is larger than the serial number of the
last joker or wild card character the result is `undef`.

Note that there is no separate function for the wild card character
sub-strings and one for the joker characters. The function `JOKER`
serves all of them counting each from left to right. The function
`JOKER` does not count, nor return the spaces, because programs usually
are not interested in the number of the spaces that separate the lexical
elements matched by the pattern.
