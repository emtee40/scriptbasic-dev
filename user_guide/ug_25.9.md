# ADDRESS( myFunc() )

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.8.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.10.md)

Return the entry point of a function or subroutine. The returned value
is to be used solely in a corresponding [ICALL](ug_25.90.md).

The returned value is an integer value that is the internal node number
of the compiled code where the function starts. The different node
numbers are in complex relation with each other and simple rules can not
be applied. In other words playing around with the value returned by the
function `ADDRESS` and then using it in an `ICALL` may result
interpreter crash raising internal error.

Note that in the argument of the function `ADDRESS` the function name
has to include the `()` characters. The function is NOT called by the
code when the function `ADDRESS` is used. On the other hand forgetting
the opening and closing parentheses will result erroneous value unusable
by `ICALL`.
