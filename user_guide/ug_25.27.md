# COMMAND()

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.26.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.27.1.md)

This function returns the command line arguments of the program in a
single string. This does not include the name of the interpreter and the
name of the BASIC program, only the arguments that are to be passed to
the BASIC program. For example the program started as

    # scriba test_command.sb arg1 arg2  arg3

will see `"arg1 arg2 arg3"` string as the return value of the function
`COMMAND()`.
