# ref v1 = v2

Assign a variable to reference another variable. Following this command
altering one of the variables alters both variables. In other words this
command can be used to define a kind of alias to a variable. The
mechanism is the same as local variable of a function is an alias of a
variable passed to the function as actual argument. The difference is
that this reference is not automatically released when some function
returns, but rather it is alive so long as long the referencing variable
is not undefined saying `undef variable` in a command.

To have an alias to a variable is not something of a great value though.
It becomes a real player when the 'variable' is not just an ordinary
'named' variable but rather part of an array (or associative array).
Using this mechanisms the programmer can build up arbitrary complex
memory structures without caring such complex things as pointers for
example in C. This is a simple BASIC way of building up complex memory
structures.
