# Addition and subtraction operators (+, -)

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_9.10.1.5.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_9.10.1.7.md)

These operators are both binary and unary operators. In their unary form
they are used out of the precedence orders. Unary operators are always
applied first, unless parentheses drive different calculation order.

If any of the operands is `undef` then the result is `undef`. If any of
the operands is real the calculation is performed using real numbers and
the result is real. If both operands are integer the calculation is
performed using integer numbers and the result is integer.
