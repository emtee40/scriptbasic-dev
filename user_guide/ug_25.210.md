# WHILE condition

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.209.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.211.md)

Implements the 'while' loop as it is usually done in most basic
implementations. The loop starts with the command `while` and finished
with the line containing the keyword `wend`. The keyword `while` is
followed by an expression and the loop is executes so long as long the
expression is evaluated `true`.

    while expression
      ...
      commands to repeat
      ...
    wend

The expression is evaluated when the looping starts and each time the
loop is restarted. It means that the code between the `while` and `wend`
lines may be skipped totally if the expression evaluates to some `false`
value during the first evaluation before the execution starts the loop.

In case some condition makes it necessary to exit the loop from its
middle then the command [GOTO](ug_25.80.md) can be used.

ScriptBasic implements several looping constructs to be compatible with
different BASIC language dialects. Some constructs are even totally
interchangeable to let programmers with different BASIC experience use
the one that fit they the best. See also [WHILE](ug_25.210.md),
[DOUNTIL](ug.md), [DOWHILE](ug.md), [REPEAT](ug_25.164.md),
[DO](ug_25.45.md) and [FOR](ug_25.68.md).
