# LEN()

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.114.1.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.116.md)

This function interprets its argument as a string and returns the length
of the string. In ScriptBasic strings can hold any value thus the length
of the string is the number of characters contained in the string
containing any binary characters, even binary zero.

If the argument is not a string it is converted to string automatically
and the length of the converted string is returned. The only exception
is `undef` for which the result is also `undef`.
