    FormatDate("format",time)

Formats a time value (or date) according to the format string. The
format string may contain placeholders. The first argument is the format
string the second argument is the time value to convert. If the second
argument is missing or it is `undef` then the local time is converted.

If the time value is presented it has to be the number of seconds
elapsed since January 1, 1970. This is the usual time stamp value
generally used under UNIX.

If the second argument is a negativevalue then this is treated relative
to the current time point. For example

    print FormatDate("YEAR MON DD HH:mm:ss", -60)

will print out the time that was one minute ago.
