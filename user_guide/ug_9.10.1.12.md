# Concatenation operator (&)

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_9.10.1.11.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_9.10.1.13.md)

This operator converts the operands to string value unless the operand
is already a string value and results a string, which is the
concatenation of the operands. The result string is placed in a newly
allocated place, in other words the operation does not alter any of the
operands.
