# LOG10

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.130.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.132.md)

Calculates the log of the argument. If the argument is zero or less than
zero the result is `undef`

If the result is within the range of an integer value on the actual
architecture then the result is returned as an integer, otherwise it is
returned as a real value.

`LOG10(undef)` is `undef` or raises an error if the option
`RaiseMatherror` is set in bit `sbMathErrUndef`.
