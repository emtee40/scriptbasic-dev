# Arrays

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_9.6.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_9.7.1.md)

Arrays are memory locations that store many values at the same time.
While normal variables store a single value at a time, an array variable
can store many values. The values are accessed via the name of the
variable and the appropriate indices. The index or indices follow the
name of the variable between `[` and `]`. This is the usual notation for
most programming languages, like C, Perl, PASCAL, Python. Some BASIC
implementations use `(` and `)` instead, but that confuses array access
and function call.

In the following subsections we describe how to use arrays.
