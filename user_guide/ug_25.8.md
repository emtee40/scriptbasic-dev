# ADDMONTH

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.7.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.9.md)

This function takes two arguments. The first argument is a time value,
the second is an integer value. The function increments the month by the
second argument and returns the time value for the same day, hour and
minute but some months later or sooner in case the second argument is
negative.

If the resulting value is on a day that does not exist on the result
month then the day part of the result is decreased. For
    example:

    print FormatTime("MONTH DAY, YEAR",AddMonth(TimeValue(2000,03,31),1))

will print

    April 30, 2000
