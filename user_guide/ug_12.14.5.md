[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_12.14.4.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_13.md)

You can use this command to close the directory listing. The syntax of
the command is

    CLOSE DIRECTORY dn

or

    CLOSE DIRECTORY #dn

Using this command you can free the space and resource allocated to the
directory listing. Directory listing may need huge amount of memory in
case of recursive listing of large directory structures. After using
this command the directory number `dn` can be used again to open another
or the same directory.
