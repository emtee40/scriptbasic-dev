# Interacting with the user

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_9.19.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_10.1.md)

Although this topic is detailed elsewhere we present a short
introduction here, because of its importance. Interacting with the user
is the most important action a program takes. There are many ways to do
it, but the most frequently used is printing to the screen and reading
from the keyboard and interpreting command line arguments. To do this
ScriptBasic has the command print and the command line input.
