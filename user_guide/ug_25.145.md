# NAME filename,filename

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.144.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.146.md)

Rename a file. The first file is the existing one, the second is the new
name of the file. You can not move filed from one disk to another using
this command. This command merely renames a single file. Also you can
not use wild characters in the source or destination file name.

If you can not rename a file for some reason, you can try to use the
command [FileCopy](ug_25.61.md) and then delete the old file. This is
successful in some of the cases when `NAME` fails, but it is a slower
method.

If the file can not be renamed then the command raises error.
