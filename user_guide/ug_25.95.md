# INSTR(base\_string,search\_string \[ ,position \] )

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.94.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.96.md)

This function can be used to search a sub-string in a string. The first
argument is the string we are searching in. The second argument is the
string that we actually want to find in the first argument. The third
optional argument is the position where the search is to be started. If
this argu-ment is missing the search starts with the first character
position of the string. The function returns the position where the
sub-string can be found in the first string. If the searched sub-string
is not found in the string then the return value is undef.
