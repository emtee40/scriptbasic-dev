# INSTRREV(base\_string,search\_string \[ ,position \] )

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.95.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.97.md)

This function can be used to search a sub-string in a string in reverse
order starting from the end of the string. The first argument is the
string we are searching in. The second argument is the string that we
actually want to find in the first argument. The third optional argument
is the position where the search is to be started. If this argument is
missing the search starts with the last character position of the
string. The function returns the position where the sub-string can be
found in the first string. If the searched sub-string is not found in
the string then the return value is undef.
