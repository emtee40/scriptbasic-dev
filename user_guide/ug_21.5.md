# Error codes

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_21.4.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_22.md)

When an error happens the error code can be retrieved using the function
`ERROR()` in the error handling code. This value is an integer value. To
compare this value against a specific error code the program should
include the file \``error.bas`'. This file defines global constants for
each run time error. It is advised to use these symbolic constants
because there is no guarantee that the actual value of an error code
remains the same between builds. The file \``error.bas`' is generated
automatically when the interpreter C language constants are generated.
The file also contains the English language explanation of each error
following the line that defines the global constant for the error code.
