# Declaration of subroutines and function

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_18.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_18.2.md)

You can declare a function like

    FUNCTION MyFunction(var1, var2, var3)
     REM function body
    END FUNCTION

You can call the function in any expression, like

    A = MyFunction(1,2,3)

Subroutine declaration is almost the same:

    SUB MySub(Var1,Var2, Var3)
     REM subroutine body
    END SUB

You can call the subroutine using the CALL statement:

    CALL MySub(1,2,3)

The major difference between functions and subroutines is that
subroutines do not have values returned. However ScriptBasic does not
differentiate between functions and subroutines. `SUB` and `FUNCTION`
are just two keywords that you can use almost interchangeable. A
subroutine can return a value and functions may be called using the call
statement, although this is not recommended.
