# DECLARE COMMAND function ALIAS cfun LIB library

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.40.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.41.1.md)

This command is used to declare a command implemented in an external
ScriptBasic library. Do NOT use this command to invoke a function from
an external DLL that was not specifically written for ScriptBasic. When
you include module BASIC files that contain `DECLARE COMMAND` lines, you
can call the functions declared this way as they were entirely written
in BASIC. You use/write a `DECLARE COMMAND` command if you developed an
external module for ScriptBasic programs in C.
