# v = expression

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.115.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.117.md)

Assign a value to a variable.

On the left side of the `=` a variable or some other ScriptBasic left
value has to stand. On the right side an expression should be used.
First the left value is evaluated and then the expression. Finally the
left value's old value is replaced by the result of the expression.

The left value standing on the left side of the `=` can be a local or
global variable, array element or associative array element.
