# SUB fun()

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.191.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.193.md)

This command should be used to define a subroutine. A subroutine is a
piece of code that can be called by the BASIC program from the main part
or from a function or subroutine.

    SUB sub(a,b,c)
    ...
    END SUB

The end of the subroutine is defined by the line containing the keywords
`END SUB`.

Note that functions and subroutines are not really different in
ScriptBasic. ScriptBasic allows you to return a value from a subroutine
and to call a function using the command `CALL`. It is just a convention
to have separately `SUB` and `FUNCTION` declarations.

For detailed information please read the documentation of the command
[FUNCTION](ug_12.14.2.md)
