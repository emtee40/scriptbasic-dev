# REPEAT

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.163.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.165.md)

This command implements a loop which is repeated so long as long the
expression standing after the loop closing line `UNTIL` becomes `true`.
The loop starts with a line containing the keyword `REPEAT` and finishes
with the line `UNTIL expression`.

    repeat
      ...
      commands to repeat
      ...
    until expression

The expression is evaluated each time after the loop is executed. This
means that the commands inside the loop are executed at least once.

This kind of loop syntax is not usual in BASIC dialects but can be found
in languages like PASCAL. Implementing this loop in ScriptBasic helps
those programmers, who have PASCAL experience.
