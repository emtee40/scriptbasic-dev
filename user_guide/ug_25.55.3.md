# EXECUTE Details

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.55.2.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.56.md)

The function can be used to start a program synchronous and asynchronous
mode as well. When the timeout value passed to the function is zero the
function starts the new process, but does not wait it to finish, but
raises an error. In this case the BASIC program can catch this error
using the `ON ERROR GOTO` structure and get the pid of the started
process from the variable `pid_v`. In this case the function does not
"return" any value because a BASIC error happened. For example:

    ON ERROR GOTO NoError
    a = EXECUTE("ls",0,PID)
    NoError:
    print "The program 'ls' is running under the pid: ",PID,"\n"

If the argument `time_out` is `-1` the function will wait for the
subprocess to finish whatever long it takes to run. For example:

    a = EXECUTE("ls",-1,PID)
    print "ls was executed and the exit code was:",a

Note that the string passed as first argument containing the executable
program name and the arguments (the command line) should not contain
zero character (a character with ASCII code 0) for security reasons. If
the command line string contains zero character an error is raised.
