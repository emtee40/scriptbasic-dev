# LOCK REGION \# fn FROM start TO end FOR mode

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.127.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.129.md)

Lock a region of a file. The region starts with the record `start` and
ends with the record `end` including both end positions. The length of a
record in the file is given when the file is opened using the statement
[OPEN](ug_12.14.1.md).

The mode can be `read`, `write` and `release`. The command works similar
as whole file locking, thus it is recommended that you read the
differences of the operating systems handling locking in the section of
file locking for the command `LOCK`. Lock a region of a file. The region
