# Cache security

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_4.2.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_5.md)

Caching is great, but there are some security issues that you have to
understand before allowing caching. The ScriptBasic interpreter is
usually available to all users in an installation. The cache directory
should be created for the interpreter and the security of the directory
should be set so that each user can read and write the directory. This
may impose security risks in a shared environment.
