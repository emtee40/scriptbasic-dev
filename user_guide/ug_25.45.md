# DO

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.44.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.46.md)

This command is a looping construct that repeats commands so long as
long the condition following the keyword `UNTIL` becomes `true` or the
condition following the keyword `WHILE` becomes `false`.

The format of the command is

    DO
     ...
     commands to repeat
     ...
    LOOP WHILE expression

or

    DO
     ...
     commands to repeat
     ...
    LOOP UNTIL expression

The condition expression is evaluated every time after the loop commands
were executed. This means that the loop body is executed at least once.

A `DO`/`LOOP` construct should be closed with a `LOOP UNTIL` or with a
`LOOP WHILE` command but not with both.

The `DO`/`LOOP UNTIL` is practically equivalent to the `REPEAT`/`UNTIL`
construct.
