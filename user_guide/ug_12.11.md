# Deleting a file or directory

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_12.10.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_12.12.md)

Using the command truncate you can truncate a file to size zero, but the
empty file is still there. To totally delete a file you have to use the
command `DELETE`. The syntax of the command is

``` 

delete expression
```

where the expression is the name of the file or directory to be deleted.
When issuing this command to delete a directory the directory should be
empty otherwise the command fails and an error occurs. There is another
command with the syntax

    deltree expression

that deletes a directory even if the directory is not empty. Note that
this command is very dangerous, because it forcefully deletes full
directory trees and therefore you have to use this format of the command
with exceptional great care.
