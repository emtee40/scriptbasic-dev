# IF condition THEN

Conditional execution. There are two different ways to use this command:
single line `IF` and multi line `IF`.

A single line `IF` has the form

    IF condition THEN command

There is no way to specify any `ELSE` part for the command in the single
line version. If you need `ELSE` command you have use multi line `IF`.

The multi line `IF` should not contain any command directly after the
keyword `THEN`. It should have the format:

    IF condition THEN
      commands
    ELSE
      commands
    END IF

The `ELSE` part of the command is optional, thus the command can have
the format

    IF condition THEN
      commands
    END IF

as well. To be very precise the full syntax of the multi-line `IF`
command is:

    IF condition THEN
     commands
    [ ELSE IF | ELSEIF | ELSIF | ELIF 
      commands
      ... ]
    [ ELSE
      commands ]
    END IF | ENDIF

You can use as many `ELSE IF` branches as you like and at most one
`ELSE` branch.

The keywords `ELSE IF`, `ELSEIF` and others are allowed for ease program
porting from other BASIC dialect. There is no difference between the
interpretation. The same is true for `END IF` in two words and written
into a single keyword `ENDIF`.
