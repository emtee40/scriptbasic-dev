# v += expression

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.120.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.122.md)

Add a value to a variable.

The variable can be a global or local variable, array element or
associative array element.

You can use this command as a shorthand for `v = v + expression`. Using
this short format is more readable in some cases and generates more
efficient code. However note that this kind of assignment operation is a
C language like operator and is not common in BASIC programs.
