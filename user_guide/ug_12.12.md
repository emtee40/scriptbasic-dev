# Creating a directory

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_12.11.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_12.13.md)

Although the `OPEN` statement automatically creates the directory for
the file whenever you want to create a new file you may want to create a
directory without creating a file in it. For the purpose the statement
`mkdir` can be used. The syntax of the command is very simple:

    mkdir expression

The expression should result a string, which is the directory to be
created. The command recursively creates the directories that do not
exist by the time the command is executed and need creation in order to
create the final directory. For example you can issue the command

    mkdir "/usr/bin/scriba"

without issuing the commands

    mkdir "/usr"
    mkdir "/usr/bin"

The directories \``/usr`' and \``/usr/bin`' are automatically created in
the unlikely case they did not exist.

The command executes without error if the directory is created or if the
directory already existed. If the directory can not be created an error
occurs. The reason for directory creation failure can be numerous. The
most typical is access control prohibiting for the process directory
creation. Another usual problem is when some sub-path of the desired
directory already exists, but is a file. For example we want to create
the directory /usr/bin/scriba/exe and /usr/bin/scriba already exists and
is a plain file.
