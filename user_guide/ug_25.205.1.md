# UNDEF Details

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.205.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.206.md)

Note that when this command is called in a function then the local
variable is undefined and the caller variable passed by reference is not
changed. Therefore

``` 

sub xx(a)
 undef a
end sub

q = 1
xx q
print q
```

will print 1 and not `undef`.

On the other hand

``` 

sub xx(a)
 a = undef
end sub

q = 1
xx q
print q
```

does print `undef`.
