# Functions and Subroutines

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_17.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_18.1.md)

Most programming languages provide a form for defining code fragments to
be used later at several times. These are subroutines and functions.
ScriptBasic allows the programmer to define subroutines before or after
they are used; to have local variables inside functions and subroutines
and allows the functions and subroutines call each other even
recursively.
