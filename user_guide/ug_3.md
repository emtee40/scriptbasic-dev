Installation of ScriptBasic is easy. Although there is no `SETUP.EXE` to
install the program, it does not require you to be rocket scientists to
install under Windows NT. Under Linux you can use the Debian or the
RedHat packages to install the program. Under other unices you should
build the and install the program from source that should be as complex
and sophisticated as typing make install.
