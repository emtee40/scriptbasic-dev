[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.202.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.204.md)

This function can be used to determine the highest occupied index of an
array. Note that arrays are increased in addressable indices
automatically, thus it is not an error to use a higher index that the
value returned by the function `UBOUND`. On the other hand all the
element having index larger than the returned value are `undef`.

The argument of this function has to be an array. If the argument is an
ordinary value, or a variable that is not an array the value returned by
the function will be `undef`.

`UBOUND(undef)` is `undef` or raises an error if the option
`RaiseMatherror` is set in bit `sbMathErrUndef`.
