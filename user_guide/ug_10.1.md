# Print

The print statement can either print to a file or to the standard
output, which is usually the terminal window. If no file number is
specified after the keyword the statement print prints to the screen. It
takes a list of expressions, formats them and prints the values to the
screen.

    print "haho!"
    print "hahaho!"
    print
    print "kukac\n"
    print "oooh"
    print "The number is ",number

The list of expression is one or more expressions separated by commas.
Old implementations of the BASIC language used `;` for that and inserted
a space between the printed item. These old BASIC languages used the
comma as list separator to put the next printed item on the next tab
position. There is nothing like that in ScriptBasic. The comma simply
separates the list elements, which are printed adjacent. Comma does not
insert space between them and does not position on tab. `;` as list
separator is not allowed.

In case you want to position something in tab position you can

    print "hello\ttab"

use the `\t` escaped character.
