# Returning a value

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_18.2.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_18.4.md)

The example above did not return any value. But functions are to return
values. To return a value from a function the code should perform an
assignment that looks very similar to a normal assignment statement. The
difference is that the "variable" that stands on the left side of the =
should be the name of the function. Let's see the previous example a bit
extended:

    a = MyFunction(1,2,MyFunction(1,1,1))
    print a
    printnl
    function MyFunction(a,b,c)
    local x
    
    print a,b,c,x
    printnl
    x = a * b * c
    MyFunction = a + b + c
    
    end function

The output is

    111undef
    123undef
    6

The value of the function call is 3 when the function is first executed.
This value is passed to the function call itself as third argument; and
is used to calculate the final values for the variable a.
