ScriptBasic is a BASIC language. As such it is line oriented. The
commands follow each other in the source file lines. The simplest
example, the usual "hello word" example is a one-liner in basic:

    print "HELLO WORLD"

You can write the commands upper or lower case or even mixed case.
Therefore the following lines are equivalent:

    Print "HELLO WORLD"
    print "HELLO WORLD"
    PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
    PrInt "HELLO WORLD"
