# Installation under Windows

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_3.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_3.1.1.md)

To install the software on Windows is quite easy. Extract the ZIP file
into a temporary directory and start the executable \``SETUP.EXE`'.

Note that another file named \``SBCAB.BIN`' should be in the same
directory where the program \``SETUP.EXE`' is. This file \``SBCAB.BIN`'
contains the files in a compressed archive that the program
\``SETUP.EXE`' reads and uses to install ScriptBasic.

After starting \``SETUP.EXE`' all you have to do is to specify the
directory where you want to install ScriptBasic, and \``SETUP.EXE`' does
the rest for you.

After you have installed ScritpBasic you can safely delete the files
\``SETUP.EXE`' and \``SBCAB.BIN`' from the temporary directory. Do not
delete \``SETUP.EXE`' that was copied into the installation directory.
This is needed to uninstall ScriptBasic in case you want to uninstall it
ever.
