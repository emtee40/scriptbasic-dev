# EXECUTE("executable\_program", time\_out,pid\_v)

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.54.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.55.1.md)

This function should be used to start an external program and wait for
it to finish.

The first argument of the function is the executable command line to
start. The second argument is the number of seconds that the BASIC
program should wait for the external program to finish. If the external
program finishes during this period the function returns and the return
value is the exit code of the external program. If the argument
specifying how many seconds the BASIC program has to wait is `-1` then
the BASIC program will wait infinitely.

If the program does not finish during the specified period then the
function alters the third argument, which has to be a variable and
raises error. In this case the argument `pid_v` will hold the PID of the
external program. This value can be used in the error handling code to
terminate the external program.
