# DO UNTIL condition

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.45.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.47.md)

This command implements a looping construct that loops the code between
the line `DO UNTIL` and `LOOP` util the expression following the
keywords on the loop starting line becomes `true`.

    DO UNTIL expression
     ...
     commands to repeat
     ...
    LOOP

The expression is evaluated when the looping starts and each time the
loop is restarted. It means that the code between the `DO UNTIL` and
`LOOP` lines may be skipped totally if the expression evaluates to some
`TRUE` value during the first evaluation before the execution starts the
loop.

This command is practically equivalent to the construct

    WHILE NOT expression
    ...
     commands to repeat
     ...
    WEND

You can and you also should use the construct that creates more readable
code.
