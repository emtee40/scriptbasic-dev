# YEARDAY

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.211.md) \[\>\>\>\]

This function accepts one argument that should express the time in
number of seconds since January 1, 1970 0:00 am and returns the year-day
value of that time. This is actually the number of the day inside the
year so that January 1st is \#1 and December 31 is \#365 (or 366 in leap
years). If the argument is missing the function uses the actual local
time.
