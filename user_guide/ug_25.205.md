# UNDEF variable

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.204.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.205.1.md)

Sets the value of a variable (or some other ScriptBasic left value) to
be undefined. This command can also be used to release the memory that
was occupied by an array when the variable holding the array is set to
`undef`.

When this command is used as a function (with or without, but usually
without parentheses), it simply returns the value `undef`.
