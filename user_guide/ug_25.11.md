# ADDWEEK

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.10.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.12.md)

This function takes two arguments. The first argument is a time value,
the second is an integer value. The function increments the week by the
second argument and returns the time value for the same hour and minute
but some weeks later or sooner in case the second argument is negative.

This function is very simple from the arithmetic's point of view,
because it simply adds 604800 times the second argument to the first
argument and returns the result.
