# SQR

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.186.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.188.md)

Calculates the square root of the argument.

If the result is within the range of an integer value on the actual
architecture then the result is returned as an integer, otherwise it is
returned as a real value.

`SQR(undef)` is `undef` or raises an error if the option
`RaiseMatherror` is set in bit `sbMathErrUndef`.

If the argument is a negative number the result of the function is
`undef` or the function raises error if the option `RaiseMathError` has
the bit `sbMathErrDiv` set.

If the square root of the argument is an integer number then the
function returns an integer number. In other cases the returned value is
real even if the argument itself is integer.

Note that this function has the opposite meaning in the language PASCAL,
namely the square of the number. This may cause some problem if you are
experienced in PASCAL programming. In that language `SQRT` notes the
square *root*\> of a number.
