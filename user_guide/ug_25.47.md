# DO WHILE condition

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.46.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.48.md)

This command implements a looping construct that loops the code between
the line `DO WHILE` and `LOOP` util the expression following the
keywords on the loop starting line becomes `false`.

Practically this command is same as the command [WHILE](ug_25.210.md)
with a different syntax to be compatible with different BASIC
implementations.

    do while
     ...
    loop

You can use the construct that creates more readable code.

See also [WHILE](ug_25.210.md), [DOUNTIL](ug.md), [DOWHILE](ug.md),
[REPEAT](ug_25.164.md), [DO](ug_25.45.md) and [FOR](ug_25.68.md).
