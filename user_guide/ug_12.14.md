# Listing files

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_12.13.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_12.14.1.md)

Up to know we have discussed instructions and operations that were
dealing with files. To access a file you needed to know the name of the
file. Many times the program does not know the file and needs to get the
list of all files in a certain directory. To do this you can use the
commands `OPEN DIRECTORY`, `CLOSE DIRECTORY` and the function
`NextFile`.

The command `OPEN DIRECTORY` opens a directory for getting the list of
the file. The command reads the list of the files and creates an
internal list of the files.

The function `NextFile` can be used to retrieve the files of the
directory opened one by one. When the last file name has been retrieved
or when there is no need to retrieve the remaining file names the
command `CLOSE DIRECTORY` should be used to close the listing.
