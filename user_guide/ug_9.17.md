Your basic program may contain a first line that looks like the title of
this section. This may seem strange for Windows users, but this is usual
in UNIX. On UNIX systems such a first line tells the operating system,
which program to use to execute the program. This is usually
`/usr/bin/scriba` on UNIX systems, but it is not a must The ScriptBasic
interpreter may be in a different location or may have different name.

When the interpreter starts the program it sees this first line and
ignores it. To ease life of ScriptBasic users this kind of first line is
ignored on Windows systems.
