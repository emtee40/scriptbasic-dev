# Handling command line arguments

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_10.2.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_11.md)

Though the command line is parsed by the interpreter up to the name of
the executable basic program name and all other command line options and
arguments are passed to the basic program to handle. To access this part
of the command line the basic program should use the function
`command()`. This function does not need any argument and returns a
string containing the command line arguments.

In the variation STANDARD the command line returned by the function
`command()` contains the parameters separated by a single space. Even if
the real command line contains multiple spaces or tabs between the
parameters it is converted to a list of parameters separated by single
space.

    ' This program demonstrates the command function
    ' start the program using the command line:
    '     scriba commandline.bas a b c d e f
    '
    print "The command line was:\n",command(),"\n"

will print

    The command line was:
    a b c d e f
