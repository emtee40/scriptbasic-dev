You can also use the command without any argument. In this case all
currently opened files and sockets are going to be closed. For those,
who want to express this behaviour this command can be used with the
keyword `CLOSEALL`. Note however that the keyword `CLOSEALL` is not a
replacement for the keyword `CLOSE`. You can not close a single file or
socket using the keyword `CLOSEALL`.
