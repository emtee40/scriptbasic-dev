On Windows NT and Linux (Debian or RedHat) the installation is simple.
On other operating system the installation is a bit more sophisticated.
You have to extract the `tar.gz` source file into a directory get
super-user privileges issuing the command `su` and have to type:

    ./setup

If you happen to need it try it now. If you face issues, then please
consult the developers guide that details how to compile ScriptBasic
sources.
