# JOKER Details

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.109.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.110.md)

When a `LIKE` operator is executed ScriptBasic stores the actual strings
that matched the joker and wild card characters from the pattern in an
array. Using this function the programcan access the actual value of the
n-th string that was matched against the n-th joker or wild card
character. For example:

    Const nl="\n"
    if "file.txt" like "*.*" then
      print "File=",joker(1)," extension=",joker(2),nl
    else
      print "did not match"
    endif

will print

    File=file extension=txt
