# Ambiguous matching

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_20.3.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_20.5.md)

Pattern matching is not always as simple as it seems to be from the
previous examples. The pattern `"*.*"` matches files having extension
and `joker(1)` and `joker(2)` can be used to retrieve the file name and
the extension. What about the file `sciba_source.tar.gz`? Will it result

    File=scriba_source.tar extension=gz

or

    File=scriba_source extension=tar.gz

?

The correct result is the second. Wild card characters implemented in
ScriptBasic are not greedy. They eat up only as many characters as they
need. If you need more flexibility then you have to use the more complex
module `RE` that implements regular expression search and replace.
