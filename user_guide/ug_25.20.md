# CALL subroutine

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.19.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.21.md)

Use this command to call a subroutine. Subroutines can be called just
writing the name of the already defined subroutine and the arguments.
However in situation when the code calls a function that has not yet
been defined the interpreter knows that the command is a subroutine call
from the keyword `CALL`.

To be safe you can use the keyword before any subroutine call even if
the subroutine is already defined.

Subroutines and functions can be called the same way. ScriptBasic does
not make real distinction between subroutines and functions. However it
is recommended that functions be used as functions using the return
value and code segments not returning any value are implemented and
called as subroutine.
