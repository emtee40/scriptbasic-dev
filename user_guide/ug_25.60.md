Get the time the file was accessed last time.

This file time is measured in number of seconds since January 1, 1970
00:00. Note that the different file systems store the file time with
different precision. Also FAT stores the file time in local time while
NTFS for example stores the file time as GMT. This function returns the
value rounded to whole seconds as returned by the operating system. Some
of the file systems may not store all three file time types:

  - the time when the file was created,
  - last time the file was modified and
  - last time the file was accessed

Trying to get a time not defined by the file system will result `undef`.
