# RND

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.171.1.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.173.md)

Returns a random number as generated by the C function `rand()`. Note
that this random number generator usually provided by the libraries
implemented for the C compiler or the operating system is not the best
quality ones. If you need really good random number generator then you
have to use some other libraries that implement reliable RND functions.
