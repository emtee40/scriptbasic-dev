# GOTO label

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.79.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.81.md)

Go to a label and continue program execution at that label. Labels are
local within functions and subroutines. You can not jump into a
subroutine or jump out of it.

Use of GOTO is usually discouraged and is against structural
programming. Whenever you feel the need to use the `GOTO` statement
(except `ON ERROR GOTO`) thin it twice whether there is a better
solution without utilizing the statement `GOTO`.

Typical use of the `GOTO` statement to jump out of some error condition
to the error handling code or jumping out of some loop on some
condition.
