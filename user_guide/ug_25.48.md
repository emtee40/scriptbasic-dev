# END

[\[\<\<\<\]](ug_25.47.md) [\[\>\>\>\]](ug_25.49.md)

End of the program. Stops program execution.

You should usually use this command to signal the end of a program.
Although you can use [STOP](ug_25.188.md) and `END` interchangeably
this is the convention in BASIC programs to use the command `END` to
note the end of the program and `STOP` to stop the program execution
based on some extra condition inside the code.
